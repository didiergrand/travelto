## Project
FEND Capstone Project: Travel App

This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. 

Install and run travel.to

Open a terminal and go to the project folder and run this :

    npm install
    npm run build-prod
    npm start

Open a web browser and you should also be able to see the app running at http://localhost:8082/
